# Prerequisites

* __[Microsoft Flight Simulator&copy; 2020][4]__, and the __Microsoft Flight Simulator Software Development Kit__

* __[Google Earth Decoder][5]__ by [Jonahex111][6]

* __[Google Earth Decoder update][7]__

* __[Blender 3.5][1]__ or superior

* __*[Lily texture Packer (optional)][2]*__: to reduce the number of texture files, you can get the [Lily texture Packer][2]. Download the last version (1.2.3). Reducing the number of texture files reduce the loading time of the scenery, and can reduce stuttering related to texture streaming inside the sim

* __*[Compressonator (optional)][3]*__: once your package has been successfully built, you can further reduce its size by using the [Optimize the built package by compressing the texture files](javascript:void(0)){ .md-button .gedot } entry of the addon menu. To do so, you have to download the [Compressonator CLI tool from GPUOpen][3].
