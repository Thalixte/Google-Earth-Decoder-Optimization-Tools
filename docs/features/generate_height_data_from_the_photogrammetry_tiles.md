# Generate height data from the photogrammetry tiles

Once the [MSFS][1] scenery has been optimized and cleaned, there are chances that the ground height data does not match perfectly with the photogrammetry tiles, like in those screenshots:

In order to fix this issue, GEDOT is able to automatically generate DEM data based on the photogrammetry tiles 3d data.

All you have to do is to select `Google Earth Decoder Optimization Tools` > `5. Generate height data based on Google Earth tiles` in the top menu.
