It does not copy the polygons, the exclusion rectangles, the landmarks, or the height map data. That's why i strongly suggest you to use this process after having optimized all the sceneries you want to merge, and before any other operations, such as the creation of the terraforming polygons, the cleaning of the 3d data, or the generation of the height map data (DEM data).</p> <p>Another interesting scenario where you can use the merge process, is when you want to add more details in a specific area of an existing scenery. Imagine that your main scenery covers a city, with 17-19 lod range for the tiles. There is an historic center in the city, and you would like this center to have more details, with 17-20 lod range for the tiles. Just initialize a new project (see Initialize a new MSFS scenery project for further details), download the tiles with 17-20 lod range, then optimize this new scenery (see Optimize an existing MSFS scenery project for further details).</p> <p>Now, you have a new scenery that covers the historic center of your city, and you want those better detailed tiles to be included in your main scenery. To do so, in Blender, just use the merge sceneries process, by selecting <code>Google Earth Decoder Optimization Tools</code> &gt; <code>(Optional) Merge an existing [MSFS][2] scenery into another</code> in the top menu.</p> <p>Here is an example of such a process: </p> <p>Final scenery size</p> <p>Be careful when using the merge sceneries process, as the \"PackageSources\" folder should not be bigger than 7.5Gb, otherwize there are risks that the scenery will not build correctly, as it seems to be a compilation limitation for the MSFS fspackagetools.exe.
